# fightingpenguins
The fightingpenguins is a group determined to find a model to best represent a dataset taken based on information on penguins.

# Libraries
The following libraries need to be installed:
- sklearn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- plot_helpers
- numpy

# Guide
To run the project, make sure the environement that contains the above libraries is activated ($ conda activate environment_name) then the attached jupiter notebooks should run. If you would like to tinker with any of the models, that follow along the code and change what you would like as desired.

# CSV
The CSV file needed is the penguins_dataset.csv. It is read in through the normalization process in each notebook.

# Documents
This file contains all of the pictures of the models that came from experimentation and determined useful for the paper.
